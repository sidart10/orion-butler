# Skills Breakdown

**Total Skills: 111+**

This document organizes all Claude Code skills into a clear hierarchy: Meta-Skills (workflows), Key Skills (high-value tools), and Domain Skills (specialized capabilities).

---

## 1. Meta-Skills (Workflow Orchestrators)

These are the "entry point" skills that orchestrate other skills and agents. They chain multiple steps together into complete workflows.

### Primary Workflows

| Meta-Skill | Chain | Use When |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `/workflow` | Router → appropriate workflow | Don't know where to start |
| `/build` | discovery → plan → validate → implement → commit | Building features (greenfield/brownfield) |
| `/fix` | sleuth → premortem → kraken → arbiter → commit | Fixing bugs or issues |
| `/tdd` | plan → arbiter (tests) → kraken (implement) → arbiter (verify) | Test-first development |
| `/refactor` | phoenix (analyze) → plan → kraken → reviewer → arbiter | Safe code transformation |
| `/review` | parallel specialized reviews → synthesis | Code review before merge |
| `/test` | unit ∥ integration → E2E | Run test suites |
| `/security` | vulnerability scan → verification | Security audits |
| `/release` | audit → E2E → review → changelog | Ship releases |
| `/migrate` | research → analyze → plan → implement | Framework/language migrations |
| `/explore` | scout (quick/deep/architecture) | Understand codebase structure |

### Build Modes (Sub-workflows)

The `/build` meta-skill has specialized modes:

| Build Mode | Chain | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `greenfield` | discovery-interview → plan-agent → validate-agent → implement_plan → commit → describe_pr | New feature from scratch |
| `brownfield` | onboard → research-codebase → plan-agent → validate-agent → implement_plan | Feature in existing codebase |
| `tdd` | plan-agent → test-driven-development → implement_plan | Test-first implementation |
| `refactor` | tldr-code (impact) → plan-agent → test-driven-development → implement_plan | Safe refactoring with impact analysis |

### Fix Scopes (Sub-workflows)

The `/fix` meta-skill has specialized scopes:

| Fix Scope | Chain | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `bug` | debug → implement_task → test-driven-development → commit | General bug fix workflow |
| `hook` | debug-hooks → hook-developer → implement_task → test hook | Hook-specific debugging |
| `deps` | dependency-preflight → oracle → plan-agent → implement_plan → qlty-check | Dependency issues |
| `pr-comments` | github-search → research-codebase → plan-agent → implement_plan → commit | Address PR feedback |

## 2. Key Skills (High-Value Tools)

## 6. Integration Patterns

### Common Chains

**Research → Plan → Build:**
```
perplexity-search (best practices)
    ↓
plan-agent (design based on research)
    ↓
/build brownfield (implement)
```

**Explore → Plan → Premortem → Build:**
```
/explore deep --output handoff
    ↓
plan-agent (using exploration context)
    ↓
/premortem deep (catch risks early)
    ↓
/build brownfield --from-handoff
```

**Debug → Fix → Test → Review:**
```
debug (investigate issue)
    ↓
/fix bug (implement fix)
    ↓
/test (run test suite)
    ↓
/review (peer review)
```

### Skill Composition

Many meta-skills internally compose other skills:

- **`/build`** uses: `discovery-interview`, `onboard`, `research-codebase`, `plan-agent`, `validate-agent`, `implement_plan`, `commit`, `describe_pr`
- **`/fix`** uses: `debug-hooks`, `dependency-preflight`, `github-search`, `plan-agent`, `implement_plan`, `qlty-check`, `premortem`, `commit`
- **`/tdd`** uses: `plan-agent`, `arbiter` (for tests), `kraken` (for implementation)
- **`/explore`** uses: `tldr-code`, `onboard`, `research-codebase`, `scout`

## 7. Tips for Effective Skill Usage

### Start with Meta-Skills
- Don't manually chain skills unless you need custom behavior
- Meta-skills handle checkpoints, error recovery, and handoffs automatically
- Use `/workflow` when unsure - it asks questions to route you correctly

### Use Premortem Before Implementation
- `/premortem deep <plan>` catches 80% of issues before coding starts
- Built into `/build` and `/fix` workflows
- Saves hours of debugging and rework

### Leverage tldr-code for Token Efficiency
- 95% token savings vs reading files directly
- Use `tldr structure` before `tldr search` before `Read`
- `tldr impact` shows who calls a function (essential for refactoring)

### Memory System
- `/recall "<query>"` before starting work on familiar problems
- `/remember` after solving non-trivial problems
- Memory persists across sessions and helps avoid repeating mistakes

### Context Management
- Use `create_handoff` before ending sessions
- Use `resume_handoff` to pick up where you left off
- Use `continuity_ledger` during long sessions before `/clear`

### Git Workflow
- `commit` skill handles user approval and Claude attribution removal
- `describe_pr` generates comprehensive PR descriptions from git diff
- Both skills are checkpointed in meta-workflows

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Don't manually read 10+ files**
- Use `tldr structure` or `tldr-code` first
- 95% token savings, better understanding

**❌ Don't skip premortem before implementation**
- Catches risks early when they're cheap to fix
- Built into `/build` and `/fix` - don't disable it

**❌ Don't implement without a plan**
- Even simple features benefit from planning
- Use `plan-agent` or at minimum `discovery-interview`

**❌ Don't use Explore agent for codebase exploration**
- Use `scout` (Sonnet) or `tldr-code` instead
- Explore uses Haiku and produces inaccurate results

**❌ Don't chain skills manually for common workflows**
- Use meta-skills (`/build`, `/fix`, `/tdd`, etc.)
- They handle checkpoints and error recovery

**❌ Don't forget to check memory**
- Run `/recall` before starting familiar work
- Saves time by leveraging past solutions

## 9. Skill Development

To create new skills, use:
- **skill-developer**: Interactive skill creation
- **skill-development**: Patterns for skill development
- **skill-upgrader**: Upgrade skills to new formats

New skills should follow:
1. Clear single responsibility
2. Documented inputs/outputs
3. Integration with existing meta-skills
4. Proper error handling and rollback
