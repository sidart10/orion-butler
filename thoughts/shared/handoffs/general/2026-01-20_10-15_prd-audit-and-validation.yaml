decisions:
  - section_renumbering: Archive Management → 5.1.11, Memory/Recall → 5.1.12 to fix duplicate 5.1.10

  - Scout agent for comprehensive document audit (found 30 issues systematically)
  - WebSearch for validating each tech choice against 2024-2025 best practices
  - Structured todo list for tracking 30+ fixes

failed: []

next:
  - Begin Phase 0 Foundation (Week 1) per PRD §9
  - Set up Tauri 2.0 + Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui project scaffolding
  - Configure shell permissions and basic routing
  - Verify pnpm tauri dev launches desktop window
