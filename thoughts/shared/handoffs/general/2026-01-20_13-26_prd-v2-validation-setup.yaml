blockers: []

questions:
  - Does user want to include additional reference docs for validation?
  - Which BMAD validation checks are most critical for this harness-focused PRD?

decisions:
  - prd_loaded: Read PRD in chunks due to 25k token limit - full document captured
  - validation_mode: VP (Validate PRD) selected by user

findings:
  - prd_structure: 10 complete sections - Executive Summary through Risks & Mitigations
  - prd_focus: Major pivot from "Butler Product" to "Claude Agent SDK Harness" architecture
  - prd_length: 2,774 lines - comprehensive document
  - no_frontmatter: PRD lacks YAML frontmatter with inputDocuments array

worked:
  - Chunked reading of large PRD file (500 lines per chunk)
  - BMAD workflow step-file architecture followed correctly

failed: []

next:
  - Ask user about additional reference documents
  - Initialize validation report at thoughts/planning-artifacts/prd-v2-validation-report.md
  - Present discovery summary and menu
  - Proceed to step-v-02-format-detection.md when user selects Continue
