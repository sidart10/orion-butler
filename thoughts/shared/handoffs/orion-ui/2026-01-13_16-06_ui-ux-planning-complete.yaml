goal: Complete UI/UX research and implementation plan for Orion personal butler
now: Run Phase 0 (verify project-dashboard fork status) then start Phase 1

test: "ls thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-orion-ui-implementation.md"

done_this_session:
  - task: Deep UI/UX research covering A2UI, canvas systems, knowledge worker needs
    files: [thoughts/research/orion-ui-design.md, thoughts/research/orion-ux-deep-dive.md]
  - task: Researched modular canvas frameworks (tldraw, Polotno, Fabric.js, Craft.js)
    files: []
  - task: Finalized tech stack with Supabase for DB+Auth+Storage
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-orion-ui-implementation.md]
  - task: Added Stripe payments with USDC stablecoin support
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-orion-ui-implementation.md]
  - task: Ran deep pre-mortem, identified 5 tigers, added mitigations to plan
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-orion-ui-implementation.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Polotno license pricing - verify before Phase 4
  - project-dashboard fork status - check in Phase 0

decisions:
  - polotno_over_tldraw: Full Canva-like editor out of box vs building from scratch
  - supabase_unified: Single platform for DB, Auth, Storage simplifies DX
  - tiptap_for_docs: Best rich text editor, used by Notion/Linear
  - a2ui_for_agent_forms: Cross-platform (mobile later), secure JSON not code
  - stripe_with_usdc: Native stablecoin support, lower fees than cards
  - hybrid_billing: Base subscription + usage overages for fair pricing
  - export_not_sync: File sync requires desktop app, simplified to export/import

findings:
  - canvas_types: Daily briefing, email compose, meeting scheduler, contact card, progress tracker, design editor, document editor
  - a2ui_benefits: Security-first (JSON not code), framework-agnostic, LLM-friendly streaming
  - stripe_usdc_us_only: USDC subscriptions in private preview, US-only - added geo-detection
  - chokidar_browser_incompatible: File watcher is Node-only, revised Phase 8

worked:
  - Deep interview approach to clarify requirements before planning
  - Pre-mortem to identify risks before implementation
  - Researching existing frameworks vs building custom

failed: []

next:
  - Run Phase 0: Verify project-dashboard fork (30 min)
  - Start Phase 1: Foundation with Supabase setup
  - Verify Polotno pricing before Phase 4
