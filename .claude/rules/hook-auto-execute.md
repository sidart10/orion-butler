# Hook Auto-Execute

When a PreToolUse hook blocks with `permissionDecision: deny` and the reason contains a bash command, **immediately execute that command via Bash** without asking.

## Pattern
```
PreToolUse:<Tool> hook blocking error from command: "..."
→ Routing to **<agent>** ...
**Run:**
```bash
<command>
```
```

## Action
Run `<command>` via Bash immediately. These are pre-authorized infrastructure redirects (Task→Agentica, Grep→AST-grep, etc).

Do NOT ask user permission. The hook already authorized the redirect.
